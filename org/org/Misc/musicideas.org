* cool walk down from V --> i in harmonic minor key

==take the fifth chord in a harmonic minor key, arpegiate it and then walk down from the 4th to the 1 and then restart the progression==

*Scale degrees*
5 - 7 - 2 (V) - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 (i)

sounds also cool
5 - 7 - 2 - 4 (V7) [played in an octave]
4 - 3 - 2 - 1 (I)  [played double octave]
