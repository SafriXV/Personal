*** Insert mode tricks
a - enters insert mode ahead of the cursor
o - enters insert mode on a new line
*** Emphasis

#hello world
# asldfjad
: hello world
*hello world*
/hello world/
_hello world_
+hello world+
*** Replace with

:[range]s/[replace]/[replace with]
:5,6s/down/mpv
;; Replaces all instances of "down" with "mpv" that occur from lines 5-6
:%s/down/mpv
;; Replaces all instances of "down" with "mpv" that occur in the entire file

/c at the end makes emacs ask to confirm emach replacement

*** Page navigation

ctrl + d - move down 1/2 screen
ctrl + u - move up 1/2 screen
ctrl + f - move down 1 screen
ctrl + b - move up 1 screen

G  - End of a file (#G works the same way as #gg @hk )
gg - Beginning of a file

.  - Redo (but at /current/ cursor)

*** Line navigation

D  - Cuts off a line, deleting everything past the cursor
C  - Does the same thing as 'D' but puts you in insert mode
dd - Delete line
cc - Change line (deletes and puts you in insert mode)
yy - Copies line

*** w s and l

[x]w - executes command on a word
[x]s - executes command on a sentence
[x]l - executes command on a character

dw - deletes one word
ds - deletes a sentence
dl - deletes one character

There's also d[i]w which I believe deletes the word irregardless of cursor position?
And d[a]w which I also don't understand

da[ - deletes a set of brackets with the text in the them
ci" - Brings you to insert mode in the nearest set of "" on that line

Words are seperated by spaces on both sides
Sentences are seperated by periods /or/ line breaks

*** Marks
**** Lowercase marks (within a file)

m[x] - sets a mark at location with identifier [x]
`[x] - goes to mark with identifer [x]
'[x] - goes to /line/ of mark with identifier [x]
'.   - jumps to previous mark

**** Uppercase marks (within any file)
*** Commands in insert mode

ctrl t - indents current line
ctrl d - outdents current line

*** Visual mode

 v      - Character wise
 V      - Line wise
 ctrl v - Block wise

*** Playing with operators

[#]i [thing]<enter><esc> will insert [thing] to the next [#] lines

*** Registers

You call registers with "[x][command] where x is an identifier

**** Examples

"adw |Cat dog frog - Stores "cat" to the a register (as opposed to default unamed register)

These registers are called upon the same whether you're adding to or using a register
"ap  - Pastes whatever is in register a, in this case "cat"

"_ is called the "black hole register" and can't be drawn from

**** Register cheat sheet

""   - Unamed register
"_   - Black hole register
"\   - Last pattern register
"-   - Small delete register (the last cut/copy that was less than an entire line long)
"1   - Big delete register (the last cut/copy that was 1 or more lines)

*** Navigating buffers
C-[direction] focus buffer [direction]
